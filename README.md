# GAN and VAE from scratch

### VAE
In this project I implement a deep convolutional variational auto-encoder from scratch, using a beta-KL divergence loss. The dataset I am using is MNIST.
I also conduct an analysis observing the impact beta has on the learning process

### DCGAN
The deep convolutional generative adversarial network I am implementing uses the CIFAR-10 dataset.
